#  Portfolio

A portfolio website which will showcase projects and/or works I have completed while at the bootcamp. 

For now, it doesn't include that much projects but will develop and make future changes as I progresses.

I will spend more time learning about semantic HTML tags, CSS, Javascript, etc to make my portfolio website polished and more interactive.
